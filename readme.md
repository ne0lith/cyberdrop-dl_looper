# This has only been developed to work if you use the V5 start file.

This environment assumes a few things:
- You are using the new v5 start file.
- Python can be run by entering "python" in your cmd/terminal.

Download the new release .zip, or find any other way to get these files in the same directory as your v5 start file.

make sure you overwrite your start file, with the one from the zip.
also make sure you place the mods folder in the same directory as your start file.

You can run looper.bat to just loop it normally
You can run looper_mods.bat to have it loop, but also the option to backup your logs directory + urls file, each run.
